<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Newz is just a collection of news items from my RSS feed.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Mostly for fun, I guess</p>
<h3>Can I submit something?</h3>
<p>As soon as I build this feature - EAT: probably never - sure.</p>
<h3>You linked to story X or Y and it's not funny</h3>
<p>This is not a question, but normally I only read the headlines.</p>
<h3>The headline is not funny</h3>
<p>This is also not a question! (And probably I don't care)</p>
<h3>Anything else?</h3>
<p>I will add here a email address where you can shout at me. And if you know me from social media, or this so called real live, you can shout at me there. But please don't shoot at me - that's not a nice thing!</p>
